21cm Wavelength  Circular_Patch_Feed  Disk  Director Yagi  Antenna and 3D Graphic Software PROJECT


A Beginner's Guide to Antenna Fabrication, Reception, Recording, Software Processing, and Graphic Display
of the 21 cm Wavelength Microwave Electro-Magnetic Emission Spectrum
from Neutral Hydrogen ( Inter-Stellar Mass ) Clouds within our Galaxy : The Milky Way


An Efficient    Low_Noise Portable   Economical
21cm Neutral Hydrogen Radio Telescope
Antenna STUDENT EDITION

If built carefully to correct dimensions
This antenna will have the same
performance as the original

& 

It is light enough to be mounted on a
low cost photo tripod 

The intent of this Project is to provide directions to fabricate a Student level 21cm Hydrogen Line
Radio Telescope able to be fully constructed with hand tools. 

This antenna as excellent performance.



Additionally, Software has been designed to Process   IF_Avg *.txt files by

Correcting the Spectra for Background Drift , 

Normalizing the Spectra to Cold Sky,  

Converting the Spectra to a logarithmic dB Scale  ( and future alternate scalings )   and

Processing the Spectra files into *.csv Formats  compatible with Rinearn 2D and 2D Graphics packages

Current Output : Raw Data 2D File,   Frame to Frame Drift 2D File ,  Drift Corrected and Normalized File 2D / 3D compatible
