21cm Wavelength  Circular_Patch_Feed  Disk  Director Yagi  Antenna and 3D Graphic Software PROJECT


A Beginner's Guide to Antenna Fabrication, Reception, Recording, Software Processing, and Graphic Display
of the 21 cm Wavelength Microwave Electro-Magnetic Emission Spectrum
from Neutral Hydrogen ( Inter-Stellar Mass ) Clouds within our Galaxy : The Milky Way

THE GOAL : For a beginner ( high school or undergrad college student ) to have everything required 
for an operational Astronomical H Line Radio Telescope System Project available in One Repository, 
and offer intriguing 3D graphics as a motivation to undertake the task !

HARDWARE :

An Efficient    Low_Noise Portable   Economical
21cm Neutral Hydrogen Radio Telescope Antenna STUDENT EDITION

If built carefully to correct dimensions This antenna will have the same
performance as the original


It is light enough to be mounted on a very low cost photo tripod 

The intent of this Project is to provide directions to 

fabricate a Student level 21cm Hydrogen Line

Radio Telescope able to be fully constructed with hand tools. 

This antenna has excellent performance.

SOFTWARE :

Jamison Adcock has designed Java Software to Process 

AirSpy SDR# Studio & Daniel Kaminski IF_Avg *.txt files by

Correcting the Spectra for Background Drift , 

Normalizing the Spectra to Cold Sky,  

Converting the Spectra to a logarithmic dB Scale  ( future alternate scalings ) 

Processing the Spectra files into *.csv Formats  compatible with

Fumihiro Matsui Rinearn 2D and 2D Graphics packages

Output : Raw Data 2D/3D CSV, Frame to Frame Drift 2D CSV , 1pt & mx+b Drift Corrected and Normalized 2D/3D CSV : all Rinearn compatible
