21cm Wavelength  Circular_Patch_Feed  Disk  Director Yagi  Antenna and 3D Graphic Software PROJECT

An Efficient    Low_Noise Portable   Economical
21cm Neutral Hydrogen Radio Telescope
Antenna STUDENT EDITION
If built carefully to correct dimensions
This antenna will have the same
performance as the original
& 
It is light enough to be mounted on a
low cost photo tripod 

The intent of this Project is to provide directions to fabricate a Student level 21cm Hydrogen Line
Radio Telescope able to be fully constructed with hand tools. 

Additionally, the details on processing the data will be added 

PLUS
Links and Code for displaying the data in 3D graphics.
